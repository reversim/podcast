Open source software is one of the biggest game-changers in our world. It has a lot of benefits, the most critical one being minimizing the time to market. But it’s not a free meal, and you should take care of many aspects when choosing one:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;- Bug fixes (“wait a minute, I need to know $lang?!”)<br>
&nbsp;- Security (“who the f*** gave full access to my credentials dir”)<br>
&nbsp;- Stability in different bad cases (“why did jobs execute dozens of times when workers lost connection”)<br>
Those can catch you one day in a very unpleasant situation.<br>
<br>
In this talk I will take you on a tour of some key indicators that you need to bear in mind when choosing an open-source library or component.</div>
