At last year's Reversim, Iftach Bar gave a beautiful talk called “Lets talk about your salary”. He taught engineers how to negotiate their salaries when getting hired. But while salary negotiation is hard for candidates, it's practically a nightmare for employers. When we hire we're faced with the impossible task of evaluating the potential value of a perfect stranger to our company, knowing that the cost of being wrong could be extremely high (especially for startups). In this presentation I will share how at BigPanda we try to minimize that risk so that eventually both sides are happy. It'll also give candidates a chance to better understand how managers think when making offers.</div>
