Smart reply suggestions have recently become available in services and products – from smart mobile keyboards on iOS and Android to reply features included in Gmail, Allo, Linkedin and Cortana in Skype. As we, the users, become more lazy, and these features become more common – how will our behavior be affected? In this session I’ll explain what drives this evolution and why is it happening now, review some top products who incorporated smart reply features, and discuss the future directions – what are the next steps of this evolution? Are we going to lose our personal touch in online communication and become communication robots?</div>
