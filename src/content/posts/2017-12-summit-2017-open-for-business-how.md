We all take part in the open world of software. We use and contribute code to the open source world, design services with an open API, integrate with existing 3rd party services, use SDKs or provide our own. Most of the time, using one of these options is a matter of a local, development productivity choice. In this session, we’ll discuss the benefits of going “all in” and designing a product / service as “productly open” from the core. Free your product team to enrich your product (using 3rd parties), but also free your clients to make their own enrichments. And most importantly - free your data, to allow your clients to make the most of it.</div>
