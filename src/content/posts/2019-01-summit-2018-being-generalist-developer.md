As a developer, do you want to be a generalist or specialist? The answer is not the same for everyone. It depends on your traits, the company you work for and even how long you are a software engineer.<br>
I was a java BE developer for 15 years and then switched to be a generalist. I did everything from web and mobile to BE, data and ops. Being a generalist does not fit everyone but if it fits you it is a hell of a ride.<br>
If you are considering being a generalist this is the talk for you.</div>
