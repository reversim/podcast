As developers, we are constantly focused on writing elegant and cutting edge code, however, meaningful code lives 99% of it's life in production, away from our prying eyes looking at an IDE screen. in the span of those 99%, issues are bound to arise and someone will have to deal with them (probably at 3 AM after a pagerduty call). 3 years of being on the on-call rotation for mission critical services at AppsFlyer have taught me some hard lessons, but made me a better developer along the way. in this session i'll describe how we should approach production issues as developers and how it makes us (much) better coders.</div>
