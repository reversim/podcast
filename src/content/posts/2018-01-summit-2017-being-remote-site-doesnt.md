Being part of a remote engineering site is reality for most people in the Israeli tech scene, from corporate America to startups hoping to 'exit' and become part of something bigger. And that’s great, really!<br>
But, it also sucks. Kind of like being the youngest in a family of nine.<br>
If you want to have impact, be heard and have a seat at the grownups’ table - it’s on you to make it happen.<br>
At WeWork, we built a remote engineering site that is an integral part of the planning, processes and decision making in the company. In our talk we’ll share some good examples of bad habits as well as best practices we followed in order to grow from multiple remote sites to one kickass distributed team.</div>
