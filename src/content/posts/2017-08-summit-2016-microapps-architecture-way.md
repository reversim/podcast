When you have a web app owned by several teams - very soon you will need to handle issues like: quality, ownership and autonomy. Using the “micro services architecture” hammer is not that trivia when your nail is a monolithic web application. How do you handle: session management, security, cross apps links and user experience ?<br>
<br>
In this talk i will describe how we did manage to solve most of the issues, and ended up with smaller web apps (aks microApps) running a modern technology, with full ownership and autonomy.</div>
