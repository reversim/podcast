What is it about philosophy that, even today, makes people sit and debate about seemingly "nothing"? How can these vague notions and abstractions have any relevance in today's world of hard facts and cold logic? In my talk, I'll try and show how philosophy, with emphasis of linguistic philosophy, relates closely to what we do in our everyday lives as programmers. How simple things like programming language selection and trying to define a bug or name a service, are all issues that carry a much more significant meaning and context than we usually give them - I'll try, for 30 minutes, to give a glimpse behind the curtain of some of our (mis)conceptions about our world of software engineering.</div>
