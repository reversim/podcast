More of today's applications are being built from smaller components and modules. However, the workflow around building with smaller components can also generate a lot of overhead. Bit is an open source project which helps developers discover, use and collaborate on shared components while distributing the development process itself.<br>
<br>
In this talk I will introduce Bit, talk about the challenges and opportunities of building a core piece of your technology with the community, the challenges of having to play hand in hand with the rapidly-changing open source ecosystem (from Git &amp; NPM to Webpack and React) and share some insights for teams who want to open source some of their projects</div>
