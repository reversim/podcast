Progressive Web Apps are changing the way we think about websites and blurring the lines between Native apps and websites. PWAs enable websites to add features we previously could only use in mobile such as:<br>
<br>
* Push notifications<br>
* Full Screen<br>
* Offline working<br>
* Splash screen, to give an app like feel<br>
* App Icon on the home screen<br>
In this talk, we'll walk through all the game-changing features PWA offers by building our own PWA.<br>
<br>
The goal is to walk away with an understanding of the powerful features PWA's offer. Additionally, we will see firsthand how to convert a site into a PWA that’s just like a native app, but without the excessive file size or the lengthy install process!</div>
