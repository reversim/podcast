The idea behind the “Apple I” personal computer, was dismissed by HP - the Google of that time. Apple’s co-founder - Woz, really wanted to build the personal computer as an HP product.<br>
Most of us have amazing ideas for improving our company’s products or culture. Unfortunately - many of them get rejected. HP’s decision, is just one example of many - where history teaches us that we are not alone. It also shows us, that our managers who rejected our ideas are not stupid - even the greatest minds in all areas have missed great ideas.<br>
How can we successfully convince our managers to support our ideas, despite the natural resistance to different ideas? And where do most engineers get it wrong?</div>
