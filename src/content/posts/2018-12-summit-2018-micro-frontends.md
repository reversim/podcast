I will tell my story. A story about a dinosaur, Mono in the wild wild front-end. At first look I was naive, I thought I could tackle it with component approach. I realize I got it backwards and my problem was scale so I turned to micro-services.<br>
<br>
During my work, I noticed that everybody started taking this road, but the results were different and there was 0 collaboration. Recently a new term was born, "micro-frontends", but still the status stayed the same.<br>
<br>
The story continues with: How I dealt with the unique characteristics of my organization. The problems we encountered and how we overcame them. What I think will be the future and how we can understand and collaborate better</div>
