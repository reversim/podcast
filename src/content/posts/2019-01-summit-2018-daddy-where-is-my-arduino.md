It’s almost midnight. Me and my daughter are looking for jumpers, matrices and resistors. There is a bug in the game we’re building, and it doesn’t seem as if we are going to bed anytime soon.<br>
<br>
Teaching kids recursion and data structures didn’t create the thrill I thought it would. But building games does! My daughter Roni and I will talk about introducing kids to the world of programing, 3D printing, Scratch, Arduino, Ali Express orders and hot glue. We’ll cover the existing tools from which kids can learn how to code, at what age should they start, and which projects to choose.<br>
<br>
And why girls at school are anxious about coding? Is it a boy’s club already before high-school?</div>
