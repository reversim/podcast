What is software design? How does it relate to writing code? many of us are using agile methodologies nowadays, but how can we reconcile these with the concept of software design as we currently know it?<br>
<br>
In this talk, I will share with the audience my personal journey with Test-Driven Development (and Design) over the last 4 years, a journey that started with me assuming that I know what TDD is and how one should write tests and over time has repeatedly proved me wrong, making me more humble and open to new ideas - and by way of that, helped me become a better engineer.<br>
<br>
This is not a talk about code. It's about adopting a Zen-like approach to software design, using TDD as our guide.<br>
