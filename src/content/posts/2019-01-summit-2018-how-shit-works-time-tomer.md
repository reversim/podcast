In this talk we'll take a hard look at one of the most commonly used, and at least as commonly misunderstood, elements in software engineering: time. Time is so fundamental to the way humans experience reality that we don't normally give it a second thought, but it's just as fundamental to software systems. Without a correct model for working with time BAD THINGS HAPPEN: data is persisted out of order, exceptions occur where they shouldn't be possible, and production systems blow up.<br>
<br>
We'll cover the various common representations of time, acknowledge their caveats and deficiencies, and hopefully learn a few new tools and practices along the way.</div>
