The everyday goal of developers and DevOps is high quality software delivery in high velocity. Security is not their focus and we believe it should not be a burden as well. Security should be natively and seamlessly integrated into the tools and platforms developers and DevOps use, so it will become effortless. Conjur Open Source is a security solution built with developers and DevOps in mind. It can free the developers to do what they do best – develop great software – but without compromising their security.<br>
<br>
In this session I will introduce Conjur Open Source, walk through how native and easy security can become and how you can get started and contribute – right after this session.</div>
