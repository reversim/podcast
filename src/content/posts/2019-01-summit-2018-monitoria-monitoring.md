Monitoring is important - but as your company grows it becomes harder to keep an eye on all the different moving parts. As the times roll by and the company grows new technologies are being added to the stack and it’s essential to make sure those can be monitored reliably out there in the wild. We want to share how we transformed monitoring from a one man job to something every developer and Product Manager cares about and actively participates in. This talk will introduce you to open source tools that can enable such a solution. Walking you through a cultural transformation that makes monitoring accessible to everyone.</div>
