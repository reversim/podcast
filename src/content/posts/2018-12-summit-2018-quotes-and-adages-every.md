Each of you probably quoted Conway's Law, or Murphy’s law more than once during his career. Did you know that there are many other quotes you can and should be using?<br>
<br>
Quotes and adages are great in capturing insights and defining a common language - kind of like Design patterns are.<br>
<br>
So, are you going to stick with only Singleton and Factory in your arsenal? Knowing some additional quotes, the ideas and anecdotes behind them can help you harness industry insights in your favor! But not only that, it would also make you look smart and funny along the way!<br>
<br>
In this talk I will cover some such “laws”, insights they capture, the rational and people behind them.</div>
