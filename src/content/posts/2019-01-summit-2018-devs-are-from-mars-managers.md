We’ve all heard it. The “business guys” want everything done, working perfectly, yesterday. The devs on the other hand say it’s not ready, any of it, ever.<br>
<br>
Such extreme stereotypes are rarely accurate, but the inherent business&nbsp; &nbsp;R&amp;D tension is very real.<br>
<br>
In this talk we’ll discuss the differences in perspective and language between the different roles in a tech company - and understand how can everyone be right while holding opposite opinions. We’ll then go over several tips on how to communicate the dev point of view in the language of business - while making sure everyone are aligned around the greater good of the company.</div>
