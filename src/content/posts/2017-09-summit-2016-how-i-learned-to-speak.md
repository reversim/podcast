I started work at Klarna four years ago, and for the first time in my life I was surrounded by developers all day long. I found myself feeling like Captain Kirk when he first met Spock.<br>
I'll tell you a bit about working with developers from my personal perspective.<br>
I'll share the things I've learned about you, the differences between people in HR and developers, and talk about what we can do to make our work together better.</div>
