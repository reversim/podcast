Roosevelt said "There is nothing to fear but fear itself", but does this hold true for shame as well?<br>
Not during Reversim's Hall of Shame, where your shameful acts are to be celebrated!<br>
<br>
Let your past mistakes bring you fame and fortune as you get 3 minutes to impress our panel of judges.<br>
You will be graded based on:<br>
The magnitude of your your error (almost getting someone killed was never so positive!)<br>
How shameful your mistakes were<br>
How well was your incident presented<br>
Should the crowd go wild in response to your talk, that will certainly sway the judges as well.<br>
So go ahead and present your fiascoes and you too could win a fantastic Hall of Shame hat, with the top 3 places getting amazing real value prizes!<br>
Don't delay, make a terrible mistake today (and tell us all about it)!<br>
<br>
