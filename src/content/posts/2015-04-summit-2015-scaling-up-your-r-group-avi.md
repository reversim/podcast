Dealing with multiple teams in a product development organization is always a challenge.<br>
<br>
I would like to share with you a live case study about how we switched from a traditional R&amp;D structure into a small product oriented start-up’s teams.<br>
These are some of the challenges we had to deal with:<br>
How to brake a single product development team into small pieces while keeping autonomy and productivity?<br>
How to use technical guilds to maintain a high technical level, personal development and collaboration between the “distributed” development team?<br>
How to create a culture, based on developer accountability even without a direct manager around?<br>
How to maintain high developers utilization in a small heterogenous feature team (iOS, Android, Web, Infrastructure)?<br>
How we use release trains model for lean development in cross mobile platforms world and, what is our strategy for continuous delivery implementation.<br>
<br>
I invite you to hear our personal experience about growing from a small start-up, to a middle size development organization. I invite you to hear how we maintained our developer happiness, start-up culture, productivity and giving each team members the ability to affect the product development (in both product and technical aspects).<br>
