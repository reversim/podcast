As product managers, our biggest fear is creating a product that nobody needs. So, how to make sure your users will want your product?<br>
<br>
In the B2C world, you have to be both data-driven and customer-centric. To make your product better, you need to:<br>
<br>
Collect input from users<br>
Understand why users churn or stay<br>
Apply that data using MVP and fast iterations<br>
We tried at Soluto different ways to collect data in the right time and context. I would like to share with you what we did and learned in the process, show methods to collect user input, what worked and what didn’t. I will also showcase examples of how to use the data and create a product your users will actually use - and love.</div>
