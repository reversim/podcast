‘When the web came out it CHANGED everything! It took us 20 years to realize that it didn’t change anything! The web has dominated us to think that it’s architecturally significant’ - Bob Martin.<br>
Today, many believe that Deep Learning is changing everything - applications don’t have to be explicitly written. But does it? DL projects have many of the same challenges as any other software project while it grows to support more features and use-cases. In parallel, most DL practitioners have little background or passion for Software Engineering. To show the importance of SE for DL - I redesigned one of the most popular DL repos to be at least 10 times easier to read and extend. Join the party!</div>
