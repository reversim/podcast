Today, numerous datasets, and code meant to generate them, are available for every enthusiastic developer and researcher to explore. Those datasets, however, can also be used for less-than-honest ends by companies and organizations. Unfortunately, only a few licences deal with licensing of open data, and none of them provide an adequate answer to this challenge. The ODsL project is meant to engage the data science and open source communities - in Israel and worldwide - in a discussion and joint effort to both build a set of open data licences suitable for the current and future challenges of a data-driven world and to encourage their use in academia, industry and government.</div>
