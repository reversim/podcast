There are about 500 people here at the event, why not make the most out of it and get to know some new people? Starting a conversation with someone new can be quite awkward, but 
meeting new people helps you connect better to the dev community, find a new job, discover investors, make new friends, find partners and opens many opportunities to learn and grow!<br>
In this fun 5 min talk I will provide some useful quick and easy tips on how to walk into any meetup, conference or even a dinner party and kick off a conversation straight away.</div>
