In 2008 the market collapsed worldwide and our one-year-old infant startup was close to joining the sad statistics. We almost run out of our seed funding and our product results were poor. After cutting down salaries we were able to get some additional funding to run the company for few more months. We understood that things need to change in how we build our product and how we validate our offering. 6 years later, we sold Check to Intuit for $360M. We are now running Next Insurance on the same concepts with exceptional results. In this talk I’ll explore how we put lean startup concepts hard at work and how we’ve been able to take our product into massive acceptance by millions of users.</div>
