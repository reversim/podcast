I've shared more than 2000 posts on SoftwareLeadWeekly.com in the past 5+ years. To share these posts, I had to read almost 14000 posts during that time, which includes blog posts, videos, books and interviews (podcasts).<br>
<br>
I want to share some of my lessons learned about:<br>
<br>
Which kind of "Growth Material" you should focus on?<br>
Where and how to find great content (good value vs. noise ratio)?<br>
How to set time for learning? (I'm a father of 2, I know how hard it can be)<br>
How to consume knowledge X2 faster?<br>
Are you seeking ways to up your game? If so, you'll enjoy this talk.</div>
