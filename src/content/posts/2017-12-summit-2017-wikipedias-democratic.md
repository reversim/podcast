Wikipedia is the de facto single source of truth for many domains in our life. The mechanisms that edit Wikipedia are mysterious at best and spoken of as evil by general media at worst. In my talk I'd like to outline the democratic, open and scientific structure of the peer-review editing process of Wikipedia. My talk will cover the bare metal rules of voting and editing customs and expectations. I'd like to give examples of the uglier sides of the current landscape as well as some points for hope. I'd like to conclude the talk by inviting everyone present to make their first edit during the talk.</div>
