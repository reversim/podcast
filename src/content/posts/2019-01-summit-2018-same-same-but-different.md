Our product wasn't complete without this one feature, so we went ahead and built it. Soon enough we came to realize users didn't use it, and even worse, they were still feeling the pain we planned to solve. We ended up finding ourselves in a situation where we had to rebuild a fresh feature from scratch. This experience thought us some good lessons that would should be heard by anyone building anything.</div>
