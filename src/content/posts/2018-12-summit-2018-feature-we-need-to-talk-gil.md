Many times we, as Developers and Product Managers, see features or products that aren't being utilized well, or don't fit in with our product or engineering vision, but we keep them just because they're already there. In this session I will introduce signs to identify when it’s time to let the feature or product go and share best practices on how to "have the talk" with the feature. We will review examples of companies who removed features/products and show how, in many cases, removing features improves your product, your offering and you.</div>
