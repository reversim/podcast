Meritocracy: a political philosophy which holds that power should be vested in individuals almost exclusively according to merit.<br>
If you're reading the above, nodding your head, wishing it was the case in your situation maybe I can help. I'd like to offer some ideas and tips for the struggles Technical Leads or Senior Engineers are facing:<br>
How can you leverage your skills to move the organization when you don't have the authority?<br>
What should you pay attention to when giving an advice?<br>
What can you do to get your concrete suggestions deployed to production instead of perishing in the source control?<br>
How should you work with your manager to plan and execute an agenda you actually believe in?
