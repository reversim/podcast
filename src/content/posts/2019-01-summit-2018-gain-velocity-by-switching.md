About a year a go we decided to move from AngularJS to Angular, after 1.5 weeks of development and refactoring we were live in prod. Result were: 0 bugs, 0 down time and most important 0 time was spent on QA. In the never ending progress of Front-End frameworks, you need to iterate fast without breaking your app. In this presentation I want to show the pipeline we built for our web apps, this pipeline gives us very fast way to reach production with very high confidence that no bugs reached production, We will talk about development, testing, build &amp; deployments and how to combine it all to one bullet proof pipeline.</div>
