The graphdb world hasn't changed much for the past couple of years, the same major players applying the same old know techniques, when I started creating my own version of a graph database, I followed the same path, but to make a difference and really standout in the crowd something had to be done differently. This talk will introduce you to and guide you through what I've learnt in the past two years creating the fastest graphdb today using basic mathematics, I hope your linear-algebra is polished!
