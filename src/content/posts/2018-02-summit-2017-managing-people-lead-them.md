Employee engagement is important for your success as a manager. This is what I experienced as a new manager of a team which doesn't trust me and aren't engaged as I'd like them to be. Thus, began my journey to explore, learn and implement best practices in increasing employee engagement. In this session, I'll share my story of how I increased my team's employee engagement. We'll learn why engagement is important both for the business as well as for each team member. I'll share practical tools that any manager can easily implement for best results.</div>
