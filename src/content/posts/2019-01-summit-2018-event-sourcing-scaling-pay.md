As event sourced micro-services become one of the most popular architectures to build a distributed, data consistent, large scale systems, many companies find themselves facing the ultimate equation of System Efficiency vs Cost. Being ready for large scale data inflow at any given time while keeping the compute cost at its lowest is a challenge we have faced at Trax as well. In this talk we will present our dedicated solution using some of the basic APIs given by all cloud provider. We have ended the journey by both reducing the delays in the system to minimum and by saving ~65% of the compute cost.</div>
