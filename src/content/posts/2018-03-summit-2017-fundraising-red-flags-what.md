After 2 years, 800 meetings with startups (seriously I counted) and a lot of casual conversations with other investment professionals I came to realise that there are recurring red flags that are unique to the situations in which Israeli startups interact with international VCs and are almost certainly not known to most Israeli entrepreneurs. This is not a session about "Israeli aggressiveness Vs. American manners" or the "israeli super technological with no business and marketing" but more a session that explains key differences in the ecosystems and how startups could be perceived negatively due to something that is both explainable and acceptable in Israel.</div>
