Content discovery services (CDS) serve content recommendations to users on publisher sites. Some of those recommendations showcase the publisher's own content, while other recommendations are sponsored by content promoters, who pay the service - and by proxy, the publisher - when users choose to consume their content.<br>
<br>
This business model puts the CDS at the center of the triangle consisting of end users, publishers and buyers. Those parties' interests are not aligned, and are sometimes at odds with each other. Despite these differences, many of the underlying optimization problems have similar structure.<br>
<br>
This talk will examine the content discovery marketplace from the viewpoints of the different actors, and will show how different business problems boil down to similar computational challenges.<br>
