Sometimes, the smallest features are the ones that make the biggest impact. Then why do we, as product managers and developers, keep pushing these small items to the bottom of our priority (after larger agendas that we feel are more important)? Why do we keep delaying these small items from sprint to sprint? In this session I will present examples of "small" features that became major game changers, provide tips for product and engineering on how to give these features the attention they deserve, and by that ensure we don't live in a world without WhatsApp's blue lines .</div>
