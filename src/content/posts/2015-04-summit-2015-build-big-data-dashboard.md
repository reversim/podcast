Considering migrating your app from Backbone / Angular / Other legacy?<br>
<br>
Building interactive dashboards requires state of the art front end application architecture.<br>
This talk unveils a new open source project <a href="https://github.com/shaialon/ember-admin-dashboards">https://github.com/shaialon/ember-admin-dashboards</a> that will allow you to build your next dashboard rapidly and serve as a starting point for your new application.<br>
<br>
The project core uses Ember.js - the leading front end framework for building large scale single page applications (http://builtwithember.io/), together with AdminLTE - the leading admin template on Github. Deployment and asset management are also handled end to end with Heroku and Ember CLI.<br>
<br>
The example dashboard uses Twitter's streaming data and includes maps, charts, and drill-down features - using Ember's components ("roughly equivalent to an E restricted, transcluded, isolate-scoped directive in Angular").<br>
<br>
Don't forget to star and fork one for your own!<br>
