“The Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which relatively unskilled persons suffer illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their ability to be much higher than it really is”<br>
It is known that developers don't necessarily make good managers, yet most companies (us included!) make the mistake of "promoting" successful developers into managerial positions. That is flat out wrong.<br>
A developer transitioning to a managerial position might find herself in one of the most difficult positions for a manager: a new team, managing people who until recently were her co-workers. Most tech companies offer very little, if any, training for first-time managers; without the tools, training, or even having a clue as to what their job is, it's no wonder that many first-time managers fail. Yet we as an industry keep putting ourselves in this dangerous position, where failure can have catastrophic effects on the organization as well as the people involved.<br>
In this talk I will discuss some of the mistakes we’ve made at Wix and the system we’re working on to support managers making their first steps including coaching, training and teaching.</div>
