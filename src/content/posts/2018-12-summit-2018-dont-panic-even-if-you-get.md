Have you ever been asked to implement some crazy idea? to scratch your right ear with your left hand? There are all kind of situations in which, as a Data Scientist, you may be asked to use your magic and find a solution for a problem that seems out of your scope. Whether those reasons are business constraints, customers demand, unavailable simple solutions, it all comes down to the same question: Would you accept the challenge? In this talk we’ll explore a real-world challenge and try to answer the following questions:<br>
<br>

What other alternatives are available?<br>
How much time and resources should be spent?</div>
