A talk presenting how we modeled and designed our services in AppsFlyer:
How Micorservices work for us, how we deal with deployment, service discovery, SOC, storage etc.
How the data that is sent to AppsFlyer is modeled as a stream of events which is delivered over Kafka and how using Kafka allows us to easily deploy new services, keeps us resilient and even helps us test our code.
How using Clojure changed how we reason about code and data and actually changed the way we develop and deploy services<br>
