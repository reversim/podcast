Just joined a company full of super-senior-10x-developers and you feel lost and scared? You want to boost up your career and become a better developer? Or maybe you just want to have more impact in your current role?<br>
The talk will focus on the state of mind and actions that can help you to maximize your impact, and improve your software skill level :)<br>
<br>
It is based on my own experience as a super fresh and inexperienced graduate joining a company where the concept junior developer didn't exist, to a meaningful team member, and later becoming a lead developer.<br>
<br>
The lecture will tackle a super important question: How can you give and get the most value from your job? come and find out.</div>
