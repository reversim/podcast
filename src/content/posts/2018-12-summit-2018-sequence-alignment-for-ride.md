As researchers and developers, we constantly face new problems, and challenge existing solutions to old problems. On beautiful circumstances, solved problems from one domain shed light on new problems from totally different domains.<br>
<br>
This happened to me while I was researching a Ride Sharing problem of optimally grouping multiple riders on a single taxi - a DNA Sequence Alignment algorithm gave inspiration for a hybrid solution, that turned out to be significantly more efficient than the original one.<br>
<br>
By sharing with you this story and its resulting algorithm, I hope to entertain your curiosity, spark your creativity, and encourage you to venture into unexpected solution spaces.</div>
