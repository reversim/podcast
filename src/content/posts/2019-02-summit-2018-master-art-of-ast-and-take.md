Think of the new tools that are taking over the Javascript ecosystem: Babel, Typescript, Rollup, ESLint, etc.<br>
What do they all have in common: they all take Javascript source code as input, and some emit Javascript code as output.<br>
This talk will be a deep dive into the basic building block all these tools share: Transforming your code into a JS Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).<br>
You'll learn to read, traverse, and manipulate the AST so you can extend Babel by writing your own plugins, or by writing custom ESLint rules to enforce your team's code conventions.<br>
You'll also learn how to create super powerful "code-mods" to automatically convert thousands of legacy ES5 scripts to ES6 in seconds.</div>
