DevOps, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?q=%23NoOps">#NoOps</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?q=%23serverless">#serverless</a> - every few years yet another movement to get rid of those pesky Ops engineers no one likes pops up. But like cockroaches, we can’t seem to be able to get rid of the buggers. Can it be we just don’t really understand what “operations” is all about?<br>
When people hear “Operations”, they think of managing servers, of automation, CI and deployment pipelines. But Operations is not about any of that - operations is about making the machines you built/purchased/programmed earn money (or whatever the goal of the organization is).

This talk introduces the principles and history of Operations Engineering, the challenges and responsibilities of practitioners and the transformations IT Ops world is experiencing in recent years.</div>
