You’ve probably heard about microservices (too much?) and how it’s used by giants like netflix and amazon. We developed many microservices in Kenshoo over the years, and enjoyed their benefits. However, not all was perfect. Each new service experienced similar obstacles, we saw large technical debt around maintenance, and adoption across the company was slow. This raised many questions: Why is adoption so slow? How do we decrease the technical debt? How do we help Ops cope? In this talk I will try to answer these questions and show how we built our “microservice platform as a service” solution and how it is boosting velocity in the organization.</div>
