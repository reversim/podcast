Having a public API is a common approach when companies want to make the shift from being a solution and become a platform.
In the last year, while developing Outbrain's Amplify public API, we had dilemmas, we faced challenges and learned valuable lessons.
In this session I will share what we have learned in term of development, execution and management of a public API, and will talk about things like:<br>
<br>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>How to build the development team, and how to set its objectives.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Why it is important that the business guys your work with will know what is API ?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Why developing public API is different in term of the involvement of the developers in the business decisions, settings the priorities and meeting the users ?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Which versioning approach to take ?&nbsp;</li>
<li>What you should know, and do before launching public API ?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Documentation&nbsp;</li>
<li>Testing - Automatic, manual&nbsp;</li>
<li>Monitoring&nbsp;</li>
<li>"This is not a pure RESTFul" is it a valid argument ?&nbsp;</li>
<li>How to maintain the internal API together with the public API ?&nbsp;</li>
<li>How to within the organization the importance of the API ?&nbsp;</li>
<li>The importance of "eating your own dog food"&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
