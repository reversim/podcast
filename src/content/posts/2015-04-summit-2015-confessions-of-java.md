After many years of Java development on various projects as a developer or architect and leading other Java developers, I felt that we can do better; we, Java developers, can be more productive. We can achieve more with less ceremonies. We can get things done with less code.
And then I met Groovy. It was not a love at first sight: "Hey, no type declarations? No return statement? No.... ". But then I realized: Under the hood, it is still the same old JVM, the syntax is just different. I can progress at my own pace: Java code is already Groovy code, I can learn feature by feature and then use it at my convenience.
That is what I did. For the first few months my Groovy code was almost a Java code, but as I conquered another feature and another feature I got it: Groovy is not only improved Java, there are many new concepts that I was not aware of them before: dynamic language, closures , functional programming, meta programming and much more.
Thanks to Groovy I became a better developer. Thanks to Groovy I learnt new concepts and now I am not afraid of any new programming language (I already did my first steps with Scala).
Come and hear my ode to Groovy.
In this talk I will share my view on why every Java developer must know Groovy. Groovy may not replace Java in your organization, but it will definitely enrich your professional capabilities and make you a better and more productive developer.
And yes, I will talk about recent 'Groovy/Grails funding announcement' that created a lot of buzz recently, you definitely want to hear what I have to say about it!<br>
