On September 2007 I started a journey. I left a position as a System Architect in a big Software company and started a career as an independent consultant. This have been a hell of a journey. Two years ago I returned to the warmth of the payroll (business was doing great btw as a freelancer). Along these years I found myself many times answering questions on how this is done. This lead me to the conclusion that the know how may be of an interest to the community and I want to share with you. I believe that anyone who considers becoming an independent contractor/consultant will greatly benefit from this talk.</div>
