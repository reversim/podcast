THIS IS A TRUE STORY.<br>
The events depicted here took place in Herzliya, 2017. Some names have been changed out of respect for the defeated. All the rest is told exactly as it happened, in honor of the victors. You want to hear this tale.<br>
This is an epic story of courage in a time of turmoil, of one small open source Israeli company overcoming an industry giant, in a fight to win the heart of a hurting industry. This is a tale of triumph, disruption and circumstance that will change the face of networking as the world knows it.</div>
