Subdivision is a somewhat opinionated JavaScript library that helps you structure your code in a highly decoupled way. It is conceptually based on a battle proven Addin-Tree concept used in projects such as SharpDevelop (C#) but with a JavaScriptish flavor. I developed the library based on my experience working on both SharpDevelop and HPE VuGen while considering the special requirements one may have when developing a web application.<br>
The library runs both in the browser and Node.js, is fully documented and has ~100% coverage in unit tests. Feel free to star/fork it on GitHub.</div>
